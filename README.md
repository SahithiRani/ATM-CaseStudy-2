# ATM-CaseStudy-2

In the program I wrote there are three classes. ATM class is the main class. connection class is the class to get sqlite connection. InsertIntoDB class is to insert a new account into the database. Among the common constraints I implemented 5 constratints(2,3,4,5,7). According to my program, new users should first register. Among registration, their information will be stored in the database. Old users should login. The program checks if the user is a valid user and provides options for the transactions. The user can 1.See his account balance 2.Withdraw cash from his account 3.Change his pin 4.Deposit cash into his account 5.Transfer amount into another account 6.Get a Mini Statement 7.Block his account 8.Unblock his account 9.Go back to Main Menu and 10 to Exit. I also used file handling. I created four text files namely current, deposit, transfer and withdraw.
